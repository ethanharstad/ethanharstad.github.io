[{"categories":["astrophotography"],"content":"The Sky-Watcher EQ6-R Pro is already an excellent mount out of the box. It has been routinely delivering 0.5 arcsecond guiding accuracy even with my fairly long refractor onboard. But there are a few things that are easy to upgrade at home that make the mount even better. I’ve outlined what I have done to my mount below from easiest to hardest (accounting for time and money).\nLoosen the RA/Dec bearings (Free) Out of the box, both the RA and Declination axis were fairly tight. With the clutches released, neither axis would swing freely when pushed, they would just quickly come to a stop as soon as I stopped pushing. It is likely that the factory has a fairly relaxed torque specification on the nuts that retain the tapered roller bearings. This stiction makes getting perfect balance difficult because it is hard to tell if the mount is balanced or stuck. The stiction also applies extra load to the motors which can slow down guiding corrections. Luckily this is an easy (and reversible) fix that requires only a couple of tools and no more than a few minutes.\nProcess Loosen the counterweight shaft retaining knob and use a a 2.5mm hex wrench to back each of the 3 set screws in the counterweight retaining assembly (the white dome that the shaft retaining knob screws into) by a turn or so. Make sure you release the declination clutch and hold the saddle while trying to loosen the the counterweight retaining assembly by hand. If you cannot loosen it by hand, a strap wrench (like you might use for a vehicle oil filter) should help. You want to loosen this only as much as needed to allow the declination axis to spin freely without introducing any up/down slop to the declination axis. When you’re happy, simply tighten up the 3 set screws and the counterweight shaft knob.\nFor the RA axis you begin by removing the polar scope cover and unscrewing the polar scope from the mount. Again, if you cannot remove the polar scope by hand, a strap wrench should get the job done. The silver ring around the polar scope is retained by 2 set screws, one on each side of the mount. Use a 2mm hex wrench to loosen each screw by a turn or two until the silver ring can be removed from the mount. You can now see a large black nut that unfortunately has smooth sides. This nut has 4 set screws around the circumfrence of the nut that need to be loosened using a 2mm hex wrench. Unlock the RA clutch and attempt to loosen this nut while holding the head of the mount stationary. If you cannot loosen the nut, a strap wrench will again be helpful. Even a strap wrench could not loosen the nut on my mount, luckily there are two unthreaded holes on the face of the nut that perfectly fit M4 screws, I could then use a screwdriver shaft like a spanner wrench across the two M4 screws. Like you did for the declination axis, you only want to loosen this nuts as much as needed to get the axis to spin freely without introduction any slop. When you’re happy, tighten up the 4 set screws and replace the polar scope, the silver ring, tighten those 2 set screws and replace the polar scope cover.\nBoth axis of your mount should now spin quite freely! It’s hard to be sure because so many things can affect guiding accuracy but it seems like I’m getting closer to 0.3 arcseconds now!\nI got this idea from Explore Learn Share on YouTube, check out his video if you want to see what this looks like.\nReplace the stock saddle ($200) ADM DUAL-EQ6-RPRO-XL Saddle The stock saddle works fine for smaller and lighter scopes that typically use a V series dovetail but it does not stay square when used with the larger D series dovetail. It still “works” but it makes me nervous. Luckily ADM makes a lovely CNC machined replacement saddle that fixes this problem and has an overall nicer fit and finish, as well is much nicer and larger hand knobs. For about $200 you can pick this up and install it in about 5 minutes. It is so easy it doesn’t even come with instructions and I’m going to follow their lead!\n","description":"Easy diy upgrades to get the most from a Sky-Watcher EQ6-R pro equatorial telescope mount.","tags":["equipment","astrophotography","eq6r"],"title":"Easy Upgrades for the Sky-Watcher EQ6-R Pro","uri":"/post/eq6r-upgrades/"},{"categories":["astrophotography"],"content":"Other Content Creators James Lamb YouTube Channel Link\nCuiv, The Lazy Geek YouTube Channel Link\nPlanning Software Astronomy Tools Link\nClear Outside Link\nStellarium Link\nCartes du Ciel Link\nAcquisition Software NINA Link\nAstro Photography Tool (APT) Link\nSequence Generator Pro (SGP) Link\nBackyardEOS Link\nVoyager Link\nNebulosity Link\nSharpCap Link\nPHD2 Guiding Link\nProcessing Software Astro Pixel Processor (APP) Link\nDeepSkyStacker (DSS) Link\nPixInsight Link\nAstro Art Link\nBooks The Astrophography Sky Atlas Seventy full-color charts cover the entire sky, with stars down to 9th magnitude and over 2000 deep-sky objects plotted in their correct size and shape, including many nebulae not found in visually-oriented atlases.\n416 emission nebulae and supernova remnants, including the complete Sharpless (Sh2) and RCW catalogs. 171 reflection nebulae, including the complete van den Bergh (vdB) catalog. 146 planetary nebulae, including the complete Abell catalog 52 dark nebulae and molecular clouds 792 galaxies (larger than 3 arcminutes) 38 galaxy groups from the Abell and Hickson catalogs 108 globular clusters (larger than 5 arcminutes) 309 open clusters (larger than 5 arcminutes) Link\nThe Astrophotography Manual Link\nThe Deep-sky Imaging Primer Link\n","description":"A collection of astrophotography resources that I have found useful.","tags":["astrophotography"],"title":"Astrophotography Resources","uri":"/post/astrophotography-resources/"},{"categories":["astrophotography"],"content":"I recently acquired the William Optics Fluorostar 91 as both a visual and imaging telescope. I selected this model because of the excellent optical quality, large number of included accessories and the avaliability of multiple options of field flatteners from William Optics. I also wanted a little bit more aperture than your standard 80mm while still staying around 500mm of focal length.\nTechnical Specifications\nConfiguration: Apochromatic Triplet Lens Material: STM coated FPL-53 Objective Diameter: 91mm Focal Length: 540mm Aperture: f/5.9 Focuser: Dual speed 3.3\" rack and pinion focuser Total Weight: 5.575kg Impression The telescope came well packaged in a double thick cardboard box. In lieu of traditional packaging materials, the telescope is packaged inside a custom soft sided carrying case.\nOn opening the carrying you immediately notice the prominent aluminum carry handle that doubles as a vixen base for a finder or guide scope. The carry handle is firmly mated to two stout rings with hand tightenable hardware securing the optical tube in the rings. The rings are attached to a extra long saddle plate with an extended vixen style rail underneath. The saddle plate has plenty of mounting options for extra accessories and has slotted holes to reposition the optical tube for balancing. All the machined components showed no signs of manufacturing defects and had very good surface finish with no blemishes in the anodizing (and the red looks great).\nPulling the telescope out of the carrying case I was pleased not to notice any wiggling of components or sliding of the focuser drawtube or retractable dew shield. The dust cover was well fitting and lined with a felt like material to prevent any scratching and ensure a light and dust proof fit. The front of the dust cover unscrews to expose the integrated clear bahtinov mask for diffraction spike assisted focusing. The dew shield itself slides smoothly on the optical tube and holds it’s possition well.\nAt the rear of the optical tube is the very beefy 3.3\" rack and pinion focuser assembly. The focuser is rotable on the optical tube for easy focusing during visual observing and it has adjustable tension so heavy eyepieces can be compensated for without applying unneeded force. The focuser wheels are very large, apparently a new addition from William Optics, with the left wheel containing a thermometer and the right wheel having the fine focus knob under a screw on shield. The end of the focuser drawtube has a field rotator with 1 degree gradations, very handy for repeatable framing from night to night.\nVisual Configuration Visual observing configuration with diagonal and eyepiece In the shipped configuration the telescope is set up for visual observing, with an extension tube leading to the William Optics Rotolock 2\" holder. The Rotolock holder has a very satisfying feel and holds my 2\" diagonal very securely while allowing a quick twist to rotate the diagonal after prolonged tracking. This entire assembly of the extension tube and Rotolock is removed for imaging purposes.\nImaging Configuration Imaging configuration with field flattener and imaging train While the FLT 91 is fairly flat, it does benefit from a field flattener if you are after perfectly flat photographs, especially with larger APS-C or full frame sensors. Both the Flat 6AIII at 0.8x and the Flat 68III at 1.0x from William Optics are recommended for this scope, however both require an adapter. The 6A requires the M92-M63 adapter from William Optics in order to mate the flattener to the back of the FLT 91 and requires the adjustable spacer on the flattener be set at 5.4mm. The 68 requires the M80-M48 adapter to set the correct spacing and reduce the threads down from the flattener as well as setting the adjustable spacer to 5mm.\nAssembling the Flat 6A Remove the visual back assembly consisting of the rotolock adapter and the large extension tube. Remove the visual back, including the extension tube Mount the M92-M63 adaptor ring onto the threads on the rear of the FLT 91.\nUnscrew the back half of the 6A flattener until the markins on the threaded barrel read approximately 5.4mm, if you have a pair of calipers you can measure the gap between the locking ring and rear of the flattener. Tighten the locking ring against the back of the flattener, reverifying the gap measurement with whatever tools you have avaliable to you.\nMeasure before and after tighening the locking ring Mount the flattener to the M63 threads of the adapter.\nMount the rest of your imaging train, ensuring that you have 55m of backfocus from the base of the threads on the flattener.\nOff-axis guider, filter wheel, and tilt plate being used to achive correct backfocus distance Set the focuser drawtube to 21mm for a good initial focus point. Conclusion So far I’m very pleased with the initial quality of the William Optics Fluorostar 91. I’ve read some forum posts about early focuser and tilt issues as well as general quality control issues but I have not seen any of that with my telescope and I have not seen any recent complaints online either. William Optics has proactively reached out to anyone affects by these issues and promised to revamp their quality control process, that seems to have had a positive effect. Time and lots of cloud free nights will be needed before I can have a qualitative option, but I’m very hopeful.\nResources Fluorostar 91 manufacturer page Flat 6AIII manufacturer page FLT 91 flattener package manufacturer page ","description":"","tags":["astrophotography","equipment","telescopes","reviews"],"title":"William Optics Fluorostar 91mm","uri":"/post/wo-flt91/"},{"categories":["astrophotography"],"content":"The Sky-Watcher EQ6-R Pro is a German Equatorial telescope mount with many improvements over other mounts that make it ideal for astrophotography.\nPayload: 44lbs / 20kg Mount Weight: 38lb / 17.2kg Tripod Weight: 16.5lb / 7.5kg Permanent periodic error correction Belt driven axes Vixen and Losmandy compatible saddle plate Assembly It’s just a tripod, it is pretty straightforward to set up.\nSpread out the tripod legs and set the tripod on roughly level ground with the stud aligned with North. If the ground is soft, it will help to put something underneath the tripod feet or fit some large washers onto the feet.\nUnlock the legs and raise the tripod to your desired observing height (bear in mind that the more the legs are extended, the more susceptible the mount is to vibration). Lock the northern leg and raise/lower the other two legs to set the North/South level. Lock one of the remaining legs and raise/lower the remaining unlocked leg to set the East/West level.\nLoosen the two azimuth adjusting bolts on the mount head and set the mount on the tripod, aligning the stud with the gap between the azimuth bolts. Slightly tighten the two azimuth adjusting bolts to gently hold the mount in place.\nSupport the mount with one hand and push the central locking shaft up into the mount, turning the shaft counter-clockwise to secure the mount to the tripod.\nSlide the accessory tray up along the locking shaft and secure the tray with the locking washer and bolt. The accessory tray is required to ensure the tripod legs remain rigid throughout observing. Attach the hand controller bracket to a tripod leg if desired.\nLoosen the knob securing the counterweight shaft and extend it, re-tighten the knob to secure the shaft again. Remove the countweight shaft cap and install the desired counterweights and/or shaft extension before replace the shaft cap for safety.\nMounting and Balancing Proper balancing of your telescope reduces the work the mount has to do which increases tracking accuracy and increases the life of your mount.\nRelease the R.A. axis clutch and set the position so that the counterweight shaft is pointing straight down before resecuring the clutch. Release the Declination axis clutch and set the axis position so that the saddle knobs are pointing up and the dovetail groove is level before resecuring the clutch.\nLoosen the saddle knobs and seat the telescope dovetail into the saddle plate, tightening the two knobs to secure the telescope.\nLoosen the R.A. axis clutch and rotate the axis until the counterweight shaft is parallel to the ground, resecure the clutch. Loosen the Declination axis clutch and rotate the axis until the telescope is parallel to the ground, resecure the clutch.\nHold the telescope with one hand and carefully loosen the Declination axis clutch. Adjust the telescope position forward/backward in the saddle until the mount is able to remain stationary without support. Verify that the mount is able to remain stationary in multiple orientations.\nHold the counterweight shaft with one hand and carefully loosen the R.A. axis clutch. Move the counterweights along the counterweight shaft until the mount is able to remain stationary without support. Tighten the counterweights and verify that the mount is able to remain stationary in multiple orientations.\nLoosen the R.A. axis clutch and rotate the axis until the counterweight shaft is pointing straight down, resecure the clutch. Loosen the Declination axis clutch and rotate the axis until the telescope is parallel to the ground, resecure the clutch. This is the “Park” and “Home” position of the mount.\nYou may get better guiding performance if you set your mount up to be “East Heavy”, that is with the counterweight side being slightly heavier before meridian flip. This can help to reduce the effect of backlash induced oscillations in the mount. Alignment Your equatorial mount needs to be aligned to the axis of rotation of the Earth in order to effectively track celestial objects.\nPreparation It is strongly recommended to mount and balance your telescope before performing polar alignment. When you set up your tripod you should have performed a rough alignment with the North Pole. If you did not, now is the time to do it (and remember how hard it is with a fully loaded mount and do it ahead of time next time).\nYou also should have already roughly set the R.A. axis’s elevation to your latitude, if you didn’t, go do that now (same story).\nRemove the polar scope caps and then loosen the declination axis clutch and rotate the axis until the hole in the R.A. axis shaft aligns with the polar scope.\nTurn on the mount to illuminate the the polar scope and verify you can see Polaris inside the scope. If you cannot see Polaris inside the field of view, verify you have aligned the mount with the North Pole and set the R.A. axis elevation to your latitude. If the stars appear blurry, turn the knurled ring on the eyepiece to focus.\nPolar Scope Alignment WHen you first purchase the mount or if you have travelled or not used the mount in a while you need to calibrate the polar scope to the R.A. axis before you can use it to perform polar alignment. You do not need to do this every time you use the mount (though it doesn’t hurt if you have the time).\nSelect a far-away, fixed object and adjust the azimuth and elevation adjustment bolts to center the polar scope reticle over this object.\nLoosen the R.A. axis clutch before turning the axis through half a turn (look at the dial to do this accurately) and then tightening the axis clutch again.\nIf the object remains at the center of the reticle then the scope is calibrated and your job is done. If the object moved, use the three adjustment screws on the polar scope to move the object halfway back to the center of the reticle.\nOnly loosen one of the screws 1/4 turn before tightening the other two screws to prevent disengaging or damaging the pattern plate. Repeat steps 1 through 3 a few times until the object stays at the center of the reticle. If the pattern plate becomes disengaged, remove the eyepiece by turning the knurled ring counterclockwise and re-engage the pattern plate. Polar Alignment Find the correct position of Polaris for your current location and time by waiting for the “Polaris Position in P.Scope=HH:MM” message after the SynScan controller finishished initializing or by using app such as Polar Finder.\nVisualize the reticle circle as a clock face and move Polaris to the indicated position. Loosen one of the azimuth or elevation knobs and then tighten the opposite knob to move Polaris. Do not try to use both axis at once and do not over tighten the knobs or you may crack your mount or the adjustment bolts.\nGoTo Alignment Setup home position…\nInitialize the hand control\nObserving!

Hobbies Those who know me would say this is by no means a complete list…\nMaking Since a very young age I’ve always been interested in how things worked. Now that I have the space and funds (but maybe not enough time) that has evolved into making my own things.\nAmateur Radio Amateur (ham) radio provides a convenient and practical outlet for making electrical devices as well as enabling several other hobbies. I first got involved with amateur radio in college, discovering the local club at the club fest they throw at the start of the semester. I immediately found out when the next license exam was (helpfuly organized by the local club) and tested and achieved all three levels of certification in one session. I was assigned the sequential callsign AC0QC but now go by the vanity callsign NV1K because the original call was very long in morse code and I kept tripping up while trying to say it aloud.\nMy favorite aspects of amateur radio are mainly the experimental ones. I love QRP digital modes, seeing how far I can talk with just a tiny amount of power (my claim to fame is currently central Iowa to Estonia with just 5 watts). I also like using amateur radio with other hobbies like first person video (FPV) transmitters for quadcopters and amateur weather ballooning.\nFirefighting/EMS Technical Scuba Diving Astrophotography Projects Fire/EMS Management Application This started as merely a seredipitous meeting of my fire department having a need at the same time that I was learning Flutter app development. I’ve seen grown it into a larger app that is fully cross platform (Android/iOS/Web/Desktop) and capable of many things: automated scheduling, data driven form collection (equipment checks), real time notifications (live incidents), and data analysis (after action reviews).\nSolid State Cosmic Ray Detection A project that I worked on in college but has captured my imagination ever since, utilizing various different electrical principles to detect and quantify cosmic rays. This started as a simple project just utilizing blacked out photodiodes capable only of capturing cosmic rays that directly hit the substrate but I’ve since experimented with much more advanced methods like scintilation panels with fiber optic readouts to solid state photomultipliers capable of counting individual photons.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Ethan E.
