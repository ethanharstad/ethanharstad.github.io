I selected this model because of the excellent optical quality, large number of included accessories and the avaliability of multiple options of field flatteners from William Optics.
I also wanted a little bit more aperture than your standard 80mm while still staying around 500mm of focal length.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting up the Sky-Watcher EQ6-R</title><link>https://harstad.co/post/eq6r-setup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harstad.co/post/eq6r-setup/</guid><description>The Sky-Watcher EQ6-R Pro is a German Equatorial telescope mount with many improvements over other mounts that make it ideal for astrophotography.
