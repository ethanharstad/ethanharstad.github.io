## Project Goals

My goals for this project are:

- must be capable of imaging the majority of the sky
- must be capable of surviving Midwestern weather extremes - high humidity in summer and bitter cold in winter
- must operate autonomously
- must produce high enough quality imagery for cloud detection for observatory scheduling
- should be able to publish results to the internet
- should be able to detect transient events like meteors
- should be powered by Power Over Ethernet
