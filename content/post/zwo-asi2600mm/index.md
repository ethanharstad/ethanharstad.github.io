<!--more-->

- back-illuminated Sony IMX571 APS-C sensor
- 16 bit ADC with 14 stop dynamic range
- 23.5x15.7mm sensor (28.3mm)
- 6248x4176 pixels (26 MP)
- 3.76um pixel size
- 1.0-3.3e readout noise
- no amp glow
- 35 deg C below ambient two stage cooling
- 256MB DDR3 buffer and USB 3.0 connection for 3.5 FPS at max resolution
- 50000e full well depth with 91% peak quantum efficiency
- Anti-dew heater

At a cooling temperature of 0 Â°C, the dark current noise is only 0.0022e/s/pixel. This means a 300s exposure will only cause 0.7e dark current noise, which is less than the readout noise.
