## Future

### Computerized automation

There are a lot of approaches to this, the few that I'm planning to evaluate are:

- ZWO ASIAir Plus fully integrated hardware/software solution
- Astroberry or similar RaspberryPi based open source software solution
- A Windows based mini pc to run a standard astrophotography suite like APT or SGP

### ZWO ASI2600 Pro Astrophotography Camera

Still evaluating if I want to get a one-shot color or monochrome camera with filter wheel for my first dedicated astrophotography camera.
